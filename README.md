# Eastern Scheduler - a Chrome browser extension for selecting schedules at Eastern #

## Installation ##
Download the ECSU Schedule Assistant from the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ecsu-course-schedule-assi/kgjbecnmdmplkdnjpmkjgajimajjlffg).

## Using the Scheduler ##
1. Open Eastern's class schedule page. Do not try to search for any specific classes. Instead get a list of all available classes by clicking on the Class Search button.
2. Open the Scheduler by clicking on the 'E' icon. Enter the courses you wish to take, and click the Find Schedules button. A new page will open with available schedules.

Note that the extension currently assumes that all courses are semester long courses.
